# Description
Lets you import Image Plane from external Image URL. I made this addon because whenever I wanted to imported an image as plane for reference  , I had to download the image and then select the file . So I wanted to get rid of that . I am new to blender addon making/python , so it would be great if any of you can rectify or improve the code :).This addon is using Florian Meyer's [Import Image As Plane addon](https://github.com/sobotka/blender-addons/blob/master/io_import_images_as_planes.py) , so all credits go to him :) . I just sort  of modified it !


## Usage
1. Download the python file
2. Install it
3. Look at the right hand of 3D Viewport where UI panels are and look for `Image Plane From URL` panel shown below and click on it
4. ![This is an image](https://github.com/sougataghar477/Import-Image-Plane-From-URL/blob/main/urlImage2.PNG?raw=true)
5. Copy an image url from somewhere and then paste it in text box
6. Click on the button below and you are good to go

## Errors
Sometimes there would be some images which may not be accesible due to security and server issues.If you see any image not showing up , now you know why . I will add an error alert soon !
