# Import-Image-Plane-From-URL
Lets you import Image Plane from image url.
Some images might not be fetched but I think that is rare . I will try to add an alert feature in future if some errors(like 404,etc) occur while fetching

# Description
I made this addon because whenever I wanted to imported an image as plane for reference  , I had to download the image and then select the file . So I wanted to get rid of that . I am new to blender addon making/python , so please it would be great if any of you can rectify or improve the code :) !
